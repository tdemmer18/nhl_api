#Get NHL boxscores and more using NHL API

Using the NHL API at the link below.
https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md#game-ids

I have created a few R scripts that utilize the NHL API.

1. Get each games boxscore for both teams in one file.
2. Get a listing of all teams and related information about the team.
3. Get a listing of all players and detailed information about them for the 2018-2019 season.
